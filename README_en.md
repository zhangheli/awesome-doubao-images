### Case 1: portrait photography，everyday snapshot style (by [@remixdesigne](https://x.com/remixdesigne))

[Source Link](https://x.com/remixdesigner/status/1923163958867038238)

<img src="cases/1/GrBzBt_asAAFI7j.jpg" width="300" alt="portrait photography，everyday snapshot style">

**Prompt**

```
Portrait photography with an everyday snapshot style, featuring a casual composition and lighting. The subject is a stylish yet sophisticated woman wearing a lightweight strapless nightgown, captured in the act of spontaneously taking a selfie while standing before a floor-length mirror in a hotel room. The scene uses the back camera of an iPhone with the flash activated, producing subtle motion blur from insufficient shutter speed. Characterized by awkward angles, asymmetrical/framing, and a composition that intentionally avoids polish or symmetry. The image quality carries a rough yet authentic everyday feel to emphasize the 'unremarkable' aspect. Captured in a 9:16 aspect ratio.
```

**Reference Image Required:** portrait photography, everyday snapshot style.
